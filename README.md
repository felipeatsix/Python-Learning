# Python-Learning :pencil:
My Python notebooks for learning.

Use [this link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) for seeing the rendered ipynb files in case Github fails to do it.  
> Note: If you get error 500, that's unfortunately expected in case many people are using it, just try later then, or download the files to use it with you own Jupyter Notebook :smile:
