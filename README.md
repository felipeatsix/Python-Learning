# Python-Learning :pencil:
My Python notebooks for learning.

Use [this link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) for seeing the rendered ipynb files in case Github fails to do it.  
> Note: If you get error 500, that's unfortunately expected in case many people are sending requests to Github making use of the same tool, just try later then, or download the files to use it with you own Jupyter Notebook :smile:
